            <h2>Royaltoys</h2>
            <p>
                In the Royaltoys project, I was responsible for creating a universal order management system, which
                provided greater visibility and control over the order status across all departments of the company.
                Implementing this solution was key to increasing operational transparency and facilitating the tracking
                of workflow.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> PHP, React Native</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Increased operational efficiency, reduced errors, and greater control over
                order status, leading to faster and more effective customer service.</p>

            <h2>WRA</h2>
            <p>
                During my experience at WRA, I was responsible for technical support and system maintenance.
                Additionally, I provided detailed training and ongoing support to clients, always prioritizing clarity
                and accuracy when explaining how to use the system.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> IT infrastructure, system management, server maintenance</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Recognition from clients for the quality of the support provided and improved
